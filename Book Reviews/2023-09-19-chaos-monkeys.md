I'm writing this a decent time after I read it, so I've had some time to ruminate on it, and also be left with the bits that really stood out.

Firstly, I'm a little surprised putting this review together that the book was published in 2016 as some of the attitudes seem a little dated.  Long story short, I don't think I would get on great with the author in real life - that's not to say that how he portrays himself isn't an exaggerated caricature - but as a Cuban immigrant to America in search of _that_ dream, I believe we're in very different places, with very different attitudes.  However, he's now incredibly well off and I'm not, so who's to say who's right!?
