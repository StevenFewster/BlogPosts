With lots to do and not much time to do it, a no-TV November and attempting 30 minutes of coding (or coding-related activities) each day, let's see how far we can get.

*Day 1* - First up, writing this very short post.  Next, reviving the `ng-tailblocks` project.  Taking tailblocks, a small UI library written with TailwindCSS, and converting it to a simple Angular application and using StorybookJS as the documentation behind it. BLOCKED: issue with SVGs that are using named css variables and how to get them either as standalone images that I can read in with img/src or some programmatic way. At the moment they're hard-coded inline which I don't like and makes for a big file.

*Day 2* - Parking the issues of yesterday, I want to build on the success of reviving the old ng-tailblocks project and just get on with implementing Storybook.  Got it installed but splitting up my templates into atoms/molecules etc. is proving harder than expected.
